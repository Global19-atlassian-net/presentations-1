 <title>Fixed Field Length</title>

  Fixed field length formats reserve the maximum lenght of a field for each
  data row. As the field length is known no field or line terminators are 
  needed, but:

 <list>
  <li>the field length information itself is not included</li>
  <li>space is wasted for textual fields</li>
  <li>use of long VARCHAR or BLOB fields is unrealistic </li>
 </list>

  This format is hardly ever used these days.
