 <title>Tab Separated Fields</title>

 <blurb>
  This format uses the TAB character as a field separator.
  This works well as long the data itself does not contain
  TABs.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  The format is also very hard to read for human
  eyes as TABs are usually expanded to spaces and not 
  distinguishable from these on display.
