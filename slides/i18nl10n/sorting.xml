	<blurb>
		How would you sort: *côté* (side), *côte* (coast), *cote* (dimension), *coté* (with dimensions)?
	</blurb>
	
	<break/>
	<blurb>
		Logical is: cote, cot*é*, c*ô*te, c*ô*t*é*
	</blurb>

<div effect="hide">
	<break/>
	<blurb>
		But the french do it like: cote, c*ô*te, cot*é*, c*ô*t*é*
	</blurb>

	<break lines="4"/>
	<blurb>The french are not the only ones with "weird" sorting!</blurb>

	<list>
		<bullet>In Lithuanian, *y* is sorted between *i* and *k*.</bullet>
		<bullet>In traditional Spanish *ch* is treated as a single letter, and sorted between *c* and *d*.</bullet>
		<bullet>In Swedish *v* and *w* are considered variant forms of the same letter.</bullet>
		<bullet>In German dictionaries, *öf* would come before *of*. In phone books the situation is the exact opposite.</bullet>
