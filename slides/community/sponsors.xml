<blurb>
 Because there is no one single company driving the development of PHP, we are

<list>
 <bullet>Developers: all the employers of all the people who contribute work to PHP</bullet>
 <bullet>Mirror sites: the 96 companies providing mirrors across the world</bullet>
 <bullet>Development machines: pair Networks (CVS server and mailing lists), VA Software (primary rsync server, documentation build machine), Synacor (www.php.net and other web servers), Rackshack (new www.php.net)</bullet>
</list>
