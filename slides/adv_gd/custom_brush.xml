<slide title="Brushes and Styles">
<blurb title="Custom Brushes">
    Although Styles are useful, they are limited to specifying patterns in the form on an array.
    More complex styles must be created in the form of brushes.
</blurb>
<blurb>
    Custom brushes are created by creating an image and then setting that image as the brush to use
    in another drawing operation using the %imagesetbrush()% function
</blurb>
<blurb>
    %imagesetbrush($img_r, $brush_r);%
</blurb>
<blurb>
    Once a brush has been defined, it can be used by setting the color of a drawing function to
    the %IMG_COLOR_BRUSHED% constant
</blurb>
