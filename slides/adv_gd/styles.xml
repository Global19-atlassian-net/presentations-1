<slide title="Brushes and Styles">
<blurb title="Changing the style">
    Although things like thickness can be modified by adjusting the brush, rendering things
    like dashed-lines require changing the style of the brush.
</blurb>
<blurb>
    Styles are defined by an array of allocated colors which represent the desired style which
    is then registered using the %imagesetstyle()% function.
</blurb>
<example fontsize="1.6em"><![CDATA[<?php
    $dashed = array($black, $black, $black, $white, $white, $white);
?>]]>
</example>
<blurb>
    Once a style has been defined, it can be used with any GD drawing function by setting the
    color to %IMG_COLOR_STYLED%
