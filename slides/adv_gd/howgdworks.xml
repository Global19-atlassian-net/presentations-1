    <blurb title="The Canvas">
        The GD Canvas is the fundamental base of all graphics using GD. It contains the bit-by-bit
        data of the image itself. A Canvas can be started from scratch, or created based on an
        already existing image.

        In PHP, a canvas is created using one of GD's %imagecreate*()% functions.
