    <blurb title="The Canvas">
        The GD Canvas is the fundamental base of all graphics using GD. It contains the bit-by-bit
        data of the image itself. A Canvas can be started from scratch, or created based on an
        already existing image.
    </blurb>
    <blurb>
        In PHP, a canvas is created using one of GD's %imagecreate*()% functions. Depending on
        how GD has been configured in PHP, some or all of the following creation functions are available:
    </blurb>
    <list>
        <bullet>%imagecreate($width, $height)% - Creates an empty canvas</bullet>
        <bullet>%imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height)% - Creates an empty 24-bit color canvas</bullet>
        <bullet>%imagecreatefromjpeg($filename)% - Creates a canvas based on a Jpeg image</bullet>
        <bullet>%imagecreatefrompng($filename)% - Creates a canvas based on a PNG image</bullet>
        <bullet>Similar functions for XPM, WBMP, XBM, and GIF files</bullet>
    </list>
