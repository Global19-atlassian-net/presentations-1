<blurb>Some general statements:</blurb>
<list>
<bullet>If a refcount is increased, it's still in use and therefore not garbage.</bullet>
<bullet>If the refcount is decreased and hits zero, the zval can be freed and is thus not garbage.</bullet>
<bullet>So only refcount decrements to a non-zero value need to be checked.</bullet>
</list>
<break/>
<blurb>
The basic algorithm checks whether it is possible to decrease their refcount by
one, and then check which of the zvals have a refcount of zero.
