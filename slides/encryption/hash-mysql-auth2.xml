		<bullet>Client connects to Server</bullet>
		<bullet>Server sends salt: *%S%*</bullet>
		<bullet>Client sends hash over hashed password and salt: *%H(H'(P) S)%*</bullet>
		<bullet>Server compares received hash with it's own computed hash (from the hashed password *%H'(P)%* stored in the database)</bullet>

	<blurb>A salt is used because without it you can authenticate simply by using a replay attack</blurb>
