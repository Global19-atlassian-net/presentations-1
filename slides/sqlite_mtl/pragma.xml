<blurb fontsize="4em">
PRAGMA is way to set various SQLite options that will either take permanent affect or only the current connection.
</blurb>

<blurb fontsize="3em" title="cache_size">
This option determines the size of the memory cache SQLite may use. The value of this option is represented by pages, each
page is roughly equivalent to 1.5K of memory. By default cache_size is set to 2000 (~2.86 megabytes).
</blurb>

<blurb fontsize="3em" title="count_changes">
Whether or not to count the number of affected rows after each operation. Turning it off may give a slight performance boost,
however it will effectively disable sqlite_changes(). This option is disabled by default.
</blurb>

<break />

<blurb fontsize="3em">
If you want to make the setting permanent, rather the a session setting, you need to prefix %default_%
to the option name.
