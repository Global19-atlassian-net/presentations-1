    <blurb title="Pulling Tables out of documents">
   When you display the value for a particular node, you recieve
   the entire contents of that node plus all of its children nodes.
   Thus, entire tables can be pulled out of HTML documents regardless
   of complexity just by saying:
   </blurb>
   <example><![CDATA[<?php
   
   if($node->id == TIDY_TAG_TABLE) {
         echo $node->value;
   }
?>]]></example>
   <blurb title="Nodes are overloaded, too!">
Just as was the case with tidy documents, the %tidy_node% class is
overloaded, meaning you can treat an instance of the object just
as if it were any other string:
   </blurb>
   <example><![CDATA[<?php
   
   if($node->id == TIDY_TAG_TABLE) {
      echo $node;
   }
?>]]></example>
