<slide title="Opening a Database">

<blurb fontsize="3.5em">
As with any database system the first thing you must do is open a database. Since SQLite is based on files
opening a database differs very little from opening a regular file.

<example><![CDATA[<?php
$db = sqlite_open("./ip.db", 0666, $error) 
	or die("Failed to connect because: ".$error);
?>]]>
</example>

<list fontsize="3.2em" title="Notes">
	<bullet>If a database does not a exist a new one will be created.</bullet>
	<bullet>Database path will be checked against %safe_mode% &amp; %open_basedir%.</bullet>
	<bullet>If database path is %:memory:% will create a memory only database.</bullet>
	<bullet>In the future the 2nd argument will allow opening the database in read-only mode.</bullet>
</list>
