In most situations when encountering an unexpected condition within a script it is better
to stop execution rather then allowing script to proceed potentially causing further 
errors and complicating debugging process.

To help simplify the process PHP has a %trigger_error()% function that can be used to
both log the error to the error log as well as terminate execution if need be.

<example><![CDATA[<?php
if (!($fp = @fopen("some_file", "r"))) {
	trigger_error("Failed to open 'some_file'", E_USER_ERROR);
}
?>]]></example>
