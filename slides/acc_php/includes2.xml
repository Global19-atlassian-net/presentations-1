<blurb fontsize="4em">
Always use full path file path when opening files, to avoid expensive normalization of the file's
path.
</blurb>

<example fontsize="4em"><![CDATA[<?php
include "/path/to/file.php";
// or
include "./file.php";
?>]]></example>

<blurb fontsize="4em">
This is very important even if you use opcode cache, since the paths of includes and normal files will
still need to be resolved.
