	<title>Component Versioning</title>

	<blurb>Versions for components have three elements: x.y.z, which have the
	following meaning:</blurb>

	<list>
		<bullet>*x*: major version number. A component with major version 0 can
		never be released publically (beta). It will only increase when there
		is a backwards compatible break in the component's API.</bullet>

		<bullet>*y*: minor version number, is used for all feature
		additions.</bullet>

		<bullet>*z*: mini version number, is used to denote bugfixes only. This
		third part can also be a string in the set: (alpha, beta1, beta2,
		beta~N~, rc1, rc2, rc~N~).</bullet>
	</list>

	<blurb>*x* and *y* show the version number of the component, the *z* is an
	addition showing the state (beta etc) or which bugfix release it
	is.</blurb>
