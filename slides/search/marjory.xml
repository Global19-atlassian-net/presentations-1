	<blurb>Marjory is a webservice for indexing and searching for documents,
	utilizing a full-text search engine.</blurb>

	<list>
		<bullet>It is somewhat similar to Solr, but is written in PHP and the underlying architecture allows for using search engines other than Lucene (no other adaptor is implemented yet, though).</bullet>
		<bullet>Marjory is based on the Zend Framework and uses Zend_Search_Lucene as the default search engine. </bullet>
