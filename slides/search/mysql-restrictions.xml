	<list>
		<bullet>Full-text searches are supported for MyISAM tables only.</bullet>
		<bullet>Full-text searches can be used with multi-byte character sets. The exception is that for Unicode, but not the ucs2 character set.</bullet>
		<bullet>Ideographic languages such as Chinese and Japanese do not have word delimiters. Therefore, the FULLTEXT parser cannot determine where words begin and end in these and other such languages.</bullet>
		<bullet>Although the use of multiple character sets within a single table is supported, all columns in a FULLTEXT index must use the same character set and collation.</bullet>
