<blurb>Have been developing for a more than a decade... PHP4 was the last
time there was real performance improvements in PHP itself. The fact
that there are "several so-called byte code caches" does not equal a
good thing. It means that PHP is broken and lots of people are trying
to fix it. It also means that none have succeeded, as that would mean
that one of them would be included in the PHP core by now.
