<list title="SOAP">
    <bullet>Formerly known as Simple Object Access Protocol.</bullet>
    <bullet>Uses XML, but you never need to touch it.</bullet>
    <bullet>Which is good, because SOAP is messy to look at.</bullet>
    <bullet>You just call functions and manipulate arrays. (Unless you want to.)</bullet>
    <bullet>A few PHP implementations: PEAR::SOAP, PHP-SOAP, NuSOAP</bullet>
    <bullet>(Dirty little secret: Nobody uses SOAP.)</bullet>
