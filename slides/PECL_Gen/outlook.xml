 <title>What's next?</title>
 <blurb>
  The next TODO (after cleanups) is definetly OO support,
  although this will most likely be implemented for PHP 5
  extensions only. Currently extensions generated by PECL_Gen
  work with both PHP 4 and 5, but unlike the rest of the 
  extension API the OO related parts of it have undergone
  some substantial changes.

  PECL_Gen can also be used as base for other code generators.
  A first example showing its capabilities in this realm is 
  UDF_Gen, a code generator for MySQL User Defined Function
  libraries.
 </blurb>

  Extensions that have been created using PECL_Gen include
  PECLS %html_parse% and %mdb_tools%. So although still not
  finished PECL_Gen is already perfectly capable of doing
  'real work' :)
