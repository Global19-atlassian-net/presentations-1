  PECL_Gen can also be used as base for other code generators.
  A first example showing its capabilities in this realm is 
  UDF_Gen, a code generator for MySQL User Defined Function

  Extensions that have been created using PECL_Gen include
  PECLS %html_parse% and %mdb_tools%. So although still not
  finished PECL_Gen is already perfectly capable of doing
