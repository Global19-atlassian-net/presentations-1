 When building an extension on Unix-like systems or within the Cygwin
environment under Windows the configure  script will try to figure out
where external libraries and header files needed by an extension are
installed on the target system. Using a "with" option it is possible
to specify where to actually look for libraries and headers. This way
it is possible to override search paths if things are not installed in
the default system paths or to specify the exact version of a package
to be used if multiple versions are installed on the target system.

<blurb>
The %&amp;lt;with&amp;gt;% tag takes three attributes: name=... for the actual name of
the "with" option, testfile for the relative path of a file to check
for while running the configure script and a list of default paths to
check if no path is given as an argument to the "with" option in
defaults.
</blurb>


<blurb>
Name and defaults are set to the extension base name and
"/usr:/usr/local" if no values are given. The testfile attribute is
mandatory.
</blurb>

<blurb>
Textual data enclosed by the %&amp;lt;with&amp;gt;% is used to describe the "with"
option in the output of configure --help calls.
