 <title>Returning resources</title>
 <blurb>
  For functions defined to return a known resource type a special
  local variable %return_res% is generated. 
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  This variables type is a pointer to the resources payload type and 
  points to an allready allocated piece of memory of this type unless
  you specified %alloc="no"% in the %resource% tag.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  All you have to do is to take care of storing the appropriate 
  payload data here. The actual resource registration and returning
  code will be generated for you.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  Resources will be covered in more detail later on.
