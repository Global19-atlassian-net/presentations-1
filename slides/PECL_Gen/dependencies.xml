 <blurb>
  Dependencies to be checked by %configure% are declared within the
  %&amp;lt;deps&amp;gt;% section.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  The %&amp;lt;deps&amp;gt;% tag itself has two attributes: %lang% 
  for the programming language you want to have code generated for 
  and %platform% for the operating systems to be supported.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  Set %lang% to %"c"% for plain C code or %"c++"% for C++ code 
  generation. By default C code is generated. C++ code generation
  should be selected for extensions making use of C++ libraries.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  Possible values for %platform% are %unix% for all Unix-like platforms
  supporting %configure% scripts, %win32% for Microsoft Windows with
  Microsoft VisualStudio as developement platform or %all% for both
  supported platforms. 
 </blurb>
 <blurb> 
  Within the %&amp;lt;deps&amp;gt;% section it is possible to
  define %configure% parameters, to specify needed header files
  and libraries and to add existing files to the extension.
