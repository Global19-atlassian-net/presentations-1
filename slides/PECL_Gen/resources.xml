  Resources are needed to handle custom C datatypes. 
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  Each resource type has its own registration list that is cleaned up
  on script end. Resources usually need a destructor callback that 
  takes care of freeing memory etc.

  PECL_Gen takes care of most of the resource registration details.
