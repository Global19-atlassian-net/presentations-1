  The Web Services Description Language, describes the API a
  web service exposes to the world. It is usually generated from
  an interface, rarely written from scratch (unless the programmer
  likes pain, a lot)
 </blurb>

  A WSDL document usually has 4 major sections: type definition,
  message definition (which refers to the types), port description
  (what input and output message are associated),
  and a binding definitions (how the ports map into the services
  methods).
