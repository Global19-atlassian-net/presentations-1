  When we have components that are loosely coupled, can be composed easily,
  and are independent, we have a system designed using a "Services Oriented
  Architecture" (SOA).
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  In the past, SOAs were built from CORBA/IDL components, JINI/RMI, or other
  similar approaches, none of which combined the characteristics provided by
  Web Services.
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  *But*, at the present time, Web Services do support some of the more
  interesting parts of SOAs: orchestration and dynamic composition of
  services, reliable aysnchronous communication, etc. Although there are
  specs in the works for all of these aspects.
