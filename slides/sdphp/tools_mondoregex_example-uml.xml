  There are more tools than the ones for editing the code, and for generating
  the documentation. We can also generate (... drum roll ...) UML diagrams!
 </blurb>
 <blurb>
  Of course, we could use our favorite diagram drawing program (e.g. *Dia*) and
  write an UML diagram, but we are *lazy*, so we use automatic ways of dealing
  with the problem. Enter *Autodia*.
 </blurb>
 <list title='Autodia: from code to UML'>
  <bullet>Is a tool that can analyze your code and generate a good (although a little
   messy at first) UML diagram of your classes.</bullet>
  <blurb>It understand Java, Perl, PHP, SQL, and others (soon Python
   too).</blurb>
  <blurb>It is written in Perl, but we will not hold that against it %;-)%,
   because the code is quite readable and well organized.</blurb>
 </list>

 <blurb title='dia2code: from UML to code'>
  You can also go the other way, if you have a nice UML diagram, you can
  generate PHP (or Java, or Perl, etc.) with dia2code.
 </blurb>
 <blurb title='Another alternative: Umbrello and xmi2code'>
  *Umbrello* is a specialized tool (unlike Dia), and supports the "standard" XMI
  format, and the companion project *xmi2code* can produce code from your UML
  description.
