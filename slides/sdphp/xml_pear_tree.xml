<slide title='PEAR::Tree'>
<blurb>
With PEAR's Tree you can process tree structures from different sources,
be it a database result set or an XML document. An interesting characteristic
of this package is that it allows you random access to tree nodes by using
an element path, in a similar way as you would address a file in a filesystem.
In the example in this slide we will use the file 
"%sdphp_talk.xml%".

<blurb title='Installing PEAR::Tree'>
First we need to install it using the pear installer:
</blurb>
<example type='shell'>
<![CDATA[
$ pear install Tree
...
install ok

$ pear list

Then we write a little bit of code to use our newly installed class.
