<title>What I'm here to talk about</title>
<list>
<bullet>I'm sick...</bullet>
<bullet>I really enjoy working with databases</bullet>
<bullet class="indent">and PHP</bullet>
<bullet>but many PHP applications are written for MySQL only</bullet>
<bullet class="indent">and I want to run them on Apache Derby and DB2</bullet>
</list>
<blurb>So in this presentation I'm going to step through the process of
what would be required to convert a large PHP application from being
limited to running on MySQL to supporting any one of a number of databases,
without sacrificing performance, and without complicating the design^1^.
