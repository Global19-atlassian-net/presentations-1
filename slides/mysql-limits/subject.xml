<title>The subject application</title>
<blurb>The application we'll be looking at (name changed to FRED to protect the innocent) is a well-known PHP content management system
that has been in existence for over five years. No slights are intended against the
developers of the code -- they created it with the intention of originally supporting
MySQL alone.</blurb>
<blurb>But that makes it a perfect candidate for our purposes.</blurb>
<list>
<bullet>It reflects a common "V1.0" application development scenario
resulting from the literal adoption of the LAMP stack.</bullet>
<bullet>FRED is now morphing into a "commercial support available for a fee" software
package that requires broader database support.</bullet>
<bullet>FRED is running into the same problems that we will see as we walk through the code.</bullet>
</list>
<blurb>~Note~: I have an idea of how FRED's team is approaching some
of these problems, and can share those with you along the way, but any
approach requires trade-offs of some kind.</blurb>
