gdchart is a fast graphing extension written entirely in C.  It can
handle most common types of graphs with the only major missing feature
being that it currently doesn't handle legends.  Either create your
own legend beside your graph, or maybe even layer it into the background
image of your gdchart graph if you have a static legend.
