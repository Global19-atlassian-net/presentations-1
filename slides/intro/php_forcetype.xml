Another Apache configuration trick is to use the %ForceType% directive to
force specific urls to be treated as PHP scripts:
</blurb>
<example title="httpd.conf"><![CDATA[<Location /products>
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>
]]></example>
<blurb>
Again, we will put this to use later on.
