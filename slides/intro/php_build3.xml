PHP can also be built as a static module directly into your Apache httpd
process.  On some systems this will be fractionally faster, but it makes
it a bit less convenient to upgrade PHP as you have to rebuild Apache as well.

<example type="shell" fontsize="1.3em"><![CDATA[
% ./configure --with-apache=/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.22 \
              --with-mysql=/usr
% make
% make install
% cd /usr/local/src/apache_1.3.22
% ./configure --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a
% make
% make install
]]></example>
