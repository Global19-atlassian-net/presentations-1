<slide title="Adding an extension">
<blurb title="Problem">
You need PHP's built-in ftp functions for the ultra-cool
script you are writing, but your service provider does not have PHP compiled
with the --enable-ftp option.</blurb>
<blurb title="Solution">
If you have a shell account on a system with the same
operating system as your web server, grab the PHP source tarball and
build using: </blurb>

<example type="shell"><![CDATA[--with-apxs --enable-ftp=shared]]></example>

<blurb>You can check which flags your provider used by putting a phpinfo() call in a script
on your server.</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<?phpinfo()?>]]></example>

<blurb>Once compiled, you will find a "modules/ftp.so" file which you can copy
to your web server and enable either by putting: </blurb>
<example type="shell">extension=ftp.so</example>
<blurb>
in your php.ini file or by adding this to the top of your script:
</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<?php dl("ftp.so") ?>]]></example>
