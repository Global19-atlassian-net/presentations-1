  This means that you should never have conditional function or class definitions.  So 
  avoid code like this:
</blurb>

<example><![CDATA[<?php
  if(!function_exists('foobar')) {
    function foobar() { echo "foobar"; } 
  }
?>]]></example>

<blurb>
  This also means you should avoid implicit conditional operations such as *autoload* and once again the
  *include_once* and *require_once* mechanisms.  So, always do includes, function declarations and class
  definitions at the top level of your scripts.  Keep your include trees simple and straightforward and
  hopefully relative to your including script, or at the very least include from the first directory
  of your include_path list.
