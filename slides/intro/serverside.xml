<blurb title="PHP is a Server-side language">
Even though it is embedded in HTML files much like the client-side
Javascript language, PHP is server-side and all PHP tags will be 
replaced by the server before anything is sent to the web browser.
</blurb>

<blurb>So if the HTML file contains:</blurb>

<example><![CDATA[<html>
<?php echo "Hello World"?>
</html>]]></example>

<blurb>
What the end user would see with a "view source" in the browser would be:
</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<html>
Hello World
</html>]]></example>

</slide>
