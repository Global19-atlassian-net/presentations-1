Many users place code in multiple files and include these files:
</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<?php
	require 'functions.inc';
?>]]></example>

<blurb>Or perhaps</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<?php
	require 'functions.php';
?>]]></example>

<blurb>
Both of these can be problematic if the included file is accessible somewhere
under the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory.  The best solution is to place these files
outside of the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory where they are not accessible directly.
You can add this external directory to your include_path
configuration setting.

Another option is to reject any direct requests for these files in your Apache
configuration.  You can use a rule like this in your "httpd.conf"
file:
</blurb>
<example><![CDATA[<Files ~ "\.inc$">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>]]></example>
