<slide title="Template API">

<blurb>
For larger projects you want to be very careful when designing how the
layers talk to each other.  I like to provide a very clean API to the 
template layer and start each project by thinking about what the ideal
template should look like.

<blurb title="Poll Example">
Let's design a little application that allows people to answer a set of
questions in various formats.  We want to make it really easy for our
content people to create new polls and we want to provide them with a flexible
template API.
</blurb>

<example title="Poll Template"><![CDATA[<?php
start_poll(1);
$os = array("FreeBSD", "Linux","OSX", "Windows", "Other");
?>
<p class="purpose">
Please answer a couple of questions for us.
</p>

<p class="question">
1. What is your name?
</p>
<?php text_answer('name',64)?>

<p class="question">
2. Which operating systems do you use on a daily basis?
</p>
<?php select_any_of($os)?>

<p class="question">
3. Which operating system do you prefer?
</p>
<?php select_one_of($os)?>

<?php end_poll(); ?>]]></example>
