Before installing or building PHP you will need to install the various libraries
you are planning on having PHP use.  We will be using the pdflib library later on
in this course.  Here is how you would download, compile and install this library.

<example title="pdflib" type="shell" fontsize="1.3em"><![CDATA[
% wget http://www.pdflib.com/pdflib/download/pdflib-4.0.3.tar.gz
% tar zxvf pdflib-4.0.3.tar.gz
% cd pdflib-4.0.3
% ./configure  --enable-php=no --without-java --without-tcl
% make
% make install 
]]></example>

But, for the most part you should be able to download the appropriate -devel package
from whataver Linux distribution you are on.
