<blurb title="Manual Notes">
At the bottom of every page of the online manual you will find user-contributed notes.
There is usually a lot of good information (and some bad) in these notes.

<blurb title="Searching">
The search box at the top of the page can be used to search the manual, entire site, mailing lists or the bug database.
</blurb>
<blurb title="short cuts">
Use %Alt-S% to move your cursor to the search box quickly, or on the manual pages you can use %Alt-L% to jump to the function
lookup field.
</blurb>
<blurb title="Show me the code!">
Every page of the site has a %show source% link at the bottom so you can see the PHP source behind that page.
</blurb>
<blurb title="Use a mirror">
In the bottom right corner you will find a %mirror sites% link.  Please choose a mirror near you.
As a general rule, each country will have a number of mirror sites named &lt;country_code&gt;.php.net.
For example, %de.php.net%, %de2.php.net%, %kr.php.net%, %kr2.php.net%.
