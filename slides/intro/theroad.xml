Announcing the Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0.

These tools are a set of small tight cgi binaries written in C.
They perform a number of functions including:

. Logging accesses to your pages in your own private log files
. Real-time viewing of log information
. Providing a nice interface to this log information
. Displaying last access information right on your pages
. Full daily and total access counters
. Banning access to users based on their domain
. Password protecting pages based on users' domains
. Tracking accesses ** based on users' e-mail addresses **
. Tracking referring URL's - HTTP_REFERER support
. Performing server-side includes without needing server support for it
. Ability to not log accesses from certain domains (ie. your own)
. Easily create and display forms
. Ability to use form information in following documents

Here is what you don't need to use these tools:

. You do not need root access - install in your ~/public_html dir
. You do not need server-side includes enabled in your server
. You do not need access to Perl or Tcl or any other script interpreter
. You do not need access to the httpd log files

The only requirement for these tools to work is that you have
the ability to execute your own cgi programs.  Ask your system
administrator if you are not sure what this means.

The tools also allow you to implement a guestbook or any other
form that needs to write information and display it to users
later, in about 2 minutes.

The tools are in the public domain distributed under the GNU
Public License.  Yes, that means they are free!

Subject: ANNOUNCE: PHP/FI Server-side HTML-Embedded Scripting Language
Date: 1996/04/16
Newsgroups: comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi

PHP/FI is a server-side HTML embedded scripting language.  It has built-in
access logging and access restriction features and also support for
embedded SQL queries to mSQL and/or Postgres95 backend databases.

It is most likely the fastest and simplest tool available for creating 
database-enabled web sites.

It will work with any UNIX-based web server on every UNIX flavour out
there.  The package is completely free of charge for all uses including
commercial.

Feature List:

. Access Logging
  Log every hit to your pages in either a dbm or an mSQL database.
  Having hit information in a database format makes later analysis easier.
. Access Restriction
  Password protect your pages, or restrict access based on the refering URL
  plus many other options.
. mSQL Support
  Embed mSQL queries right in your HTML source files
. Postgres95 Support
  Embed Postgres95 queries right in your HTML source files
. DBM Support
  DB,DBM,NDBM and GDBM are all supported
. RFC-1867 File Upload Support
  Create file upload forms
. Variables, Arrays, Associative Arrays
. User-Defined Functions with static variables + recursion 
. Conditionals and While loops
  Writing conditional dynamic web pages could not be easier than with
  the PHP/FI conditionals and looping support
. Extended Regular Expressions
  Powerful string manipulation support through full regexp support
. Raw HTTP Header Control
  Lets you send customized HTTP headers to the browser for advanced 
  Features such as cookies.
. Dynamic GIF Image Creation
  Thomas Boutell's GD library is supported through an easy-to-use set of
  tags.

                        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                           PHP 3.0 RELEASED

June 6, 1998 -- The PHP Development Team announced the release of
PHP 3.0, the latest release of the server-side scripting solution already
in use on over 70,000 World Wide Web sites.

This all-new version of the popular scripting language includes support
for all major operating systems (Windows 95/NT, most versions of Unix,
and Macintosh) and web servers (including Apache, Netscape servers,
WebSite Pro, and Microsoft Internet Information Server).

PHP 3.0 also supports a wide range of databases, including Oracle, Sybase,
Solid, MySQ, mSQL, and PostgreSQL, as well as ODBC data sources.

New features include persistent database connections, support for the
SNMP and IMAP protocols, and a revamped C API for extending the language
with new features.

"PHP is a very programmer-friendly scripting language suitable for
people with little or no programming experience as well as the
seasoned web developer who needs to get things done quickly.  The
best thing about PHP is that you get results quickly," said
Rasmus Lerdorf, one of the developers of the language.

"Version 3 provides a much more powerful, reliable and efficient
implementation of the language, while maintaining the ease of use and
rapid development that were the key to PHP's success in the past",
added Andi Gutmans, one of the implementors of the new language core.

"At Circle Net we have found PHP to be the most robust platform for
rapid web-based application development available today," said Troy
Cobb, Chief Technology Officer at Circle Net, Inc.  "Our use of PHP
has cut our development time in half, and more than doubled our client
satisfaction.  PHP has enabled us to provide database-driven dynamic
solutions which perform at phenomenal speeds."

PHP 3.0 is available for free download in source form and binaries for
several platforms at http://www.php.net/.

The PHP Development Team is an international group of programmers who
lead the open development of PHP and related projects.
