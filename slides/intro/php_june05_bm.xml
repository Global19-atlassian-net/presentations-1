Yahoo! has enhanced the APC opcode cache to support PHP-5.1.
</blurb>

<example type="shell" title="" fontsize="1.5em">
PHP-4.3.11 (optimized)       176.135 fetches/sec
PHP-5.1 SWITCH               195.344 fetches/sec
PHP-5.1 GOTO                 198.707 fetches/sec
PHP-5.1 CALL                 199.342 fetches/sec
PHP-4.3.11 (optimized) APC   209.342 fetches/sec
PHP-5.1 CALL APC             252.968 fetches/sec
</example>

The different VM models in PHP5.1 are very compiler sensitive.  The following 
tests were run on a FreeBSD-4.3 system and compiled with gcc-2.95.  On more 
modern compilers you should theoretically see better numbers from the GOTO VM, 
but the differences are usually not all that dramatic.
