<slide title="The Perl alternative">

<blurb>Perl became an obvious choice because it was made for text processing.  The same thing in Perl using CGI.pm:</blurb>

<example><![CDATA[use CGI qw(:standard);
print header;
print start_html('Form Example'),
    h1('My Example Form'),
    start_form,
    "Name: ", textfield('name'),
    p,
    "Age: ", textfield('age'),
    p,
    submit,
    end_form;
if(param()) {
    print "Hi ",em(param('name')),
        "You are ",em(param('age')),
        " years old";
}
print end_html;]]></example>

<blurb>Much easier both to read and to write, at least to people with a bit of a programming background.</blurb>
