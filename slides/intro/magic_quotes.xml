<blurb title="Escaping troublesome characters">
When you are inserting data into a MySQL database, certain characters have a special
meaning and must therefore be escaped if you wish to insert these characters literally.
</blurb>

<blurb>By default, PHP will escape these characters for you in any data coming from the
user in GET, Post or Cookie data.  This magic escaping is known as |ff1111|Magic Quotes| and can
be configured in your %php.ini% file by setting the |ff1111|magic_quotes_gpc| directive.
</blurb>

<blurb>The characters affected are \ ' " and NUL (char 0).  If these characters appear in 
user-supplied data they will be escaped with a \ (backslash).
</blurb>

<blurb>Some people prefer to turn this feature off and handle escaping data manually using
the %addslashes()% function.  There is a converse function, %stripslashes()%, which removes
the backslash characters in an escaped string.
