"Historically, we haven't had to use it in our search rankings,
 but a lot of people within Google think that the web should be fast.
 It should be a good experience, and so it's sort of fair to say that
 if you're a fast site, maybe you should get a little bit of a bonus.
 If you really have an awfully slow site, then maybe users don't want
 that as much."
