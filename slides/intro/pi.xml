$PATH_INFO is your friend when it comes to creating clean URLS.  Take for
example this URL:
</blurb>
<example format="text">http://www.company.com/products/routers</example>
<blurb>
If the Apache configuration contains this block:
</blurb>
<example type="shell"><![CDATA[<Location "/products">
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>]]></example>
<blurb>
Then all you have to do is create a PHP script in your DOCUMENT_ROOT named
'products' and you can use the $PATH_INFO variable which will contain the
string, '/routers', to make a DB query.
