	<list title="Data Poisoning, Bait and Decoys">

	<list title="Examples">
		<bullet>Artificial user data that includes genuine contact information that is monitored. (good for employee and paper leaks)</bullet>
		<bullet>Artificial user data that triggers warning systems if accessed.</bullet>
		<bullet>Disguise the data entry requested by a user by mixing it with non-requested data.</bullet>
		<bullet>Generate additional entries in systems where the cost of compromise is relatively low. (Same data, modify keys)</bullet>
