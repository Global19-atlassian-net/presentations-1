	<title>Define classes before using them</title>

	<blurb>In PHP 4 it was never necessary to define a class before using it in your code, although it would decrease script execution times a bit. The same is true for PHP 5, but if you are using Interfaces in your code, then you are *required* to define a class before using it.</blurb>
