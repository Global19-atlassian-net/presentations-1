<list fontsize="3.5em">
	<bullet>VersionMismatch: invalid namespace for the SOAP Envelope</bullet>
	<bullet>MustUnderstand: a required header was not understood by the server</bullet>
	<bullet>Client: the message sent by the client was not properly formed, or did
not contain the necessary information to fulfill the request.</bullet>

<blurb fontsize="4em">Faults can also contain other information, such as a
basic message describing the fault, the URI of the originator of the fault, and a
detail field that can be used to provide additional information on the fault.
