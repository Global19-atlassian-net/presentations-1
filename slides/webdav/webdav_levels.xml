 <blurb title="For a minimal Server">
  you only need to implement %GET()%, %PUT()% and %PROPFIND()%.
  Such a minimal server is not at all compliant to the sepcs
  but may already work with some clients.
 </blurb>

 <blurb title="For a DAV level 1 compliant server">
  you also need %COPY()%, %MOVE()%, %DELETE()% and %PROPPATCH()%.
 </blurb>

 <blurb title="A DAV level 2 complient server">
  has to implement locking, so you also need %LOCK()%, %UNLOCK()%
  and %CHECKLOCK()%.
 </blurb>

 <blurb title="A versioning server">

  of the this PHP package.
