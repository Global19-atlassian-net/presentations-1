  As an alternative you may just return a readable PHP stream
  together with size and modification time information from
  the %GET()% method. By doing so you do not have to deal
  with HTTP header generation yourself and get support for
  partial %GET% requests without taking further action as
  an additional benefit.

  Note that no further error checking is needed on calling %fopen()% 
  here. The base class will take appropriate action if
  the returned stream is not a PHP resource or not readable.
