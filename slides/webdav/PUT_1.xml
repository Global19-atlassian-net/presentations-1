 <title>Storing content with %PUT()%</title>
 <blurb>
  The HTTP %PUT% request method is used to write data to a resource on the server.
  The %PUT()% method is called by the base class with the following elements of
  its parameter array filled:
 </blurb>
 <list> 
  <li>'%path%': the resource the received data should be put into</li>
  <li>'%content_length%': the number of bytes transfered</li>
  <li>'%content_type%': the content type of the data transfered</li>
  <li>'%stream%': a PHP stream you can read the actual data from</li>
  <li>'%ranges%': an array of byte range specifications to be written on partial requests</li>
 </list>
 <blurb>
  As with the %GET()% method you may either handle a %PUT% request yourself or just return
  a writable stream and have the base class write to it.
