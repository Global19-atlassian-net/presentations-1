<blurb>Text Statistics is a PEAR package to calculate statistics for documents including readability scores.  One of its more intensive operations is calculating the number of syllables in a word, which is calculated through a number of regexps.  We can improve its performance on moderate-large documents by caching word objects.</blurb>
