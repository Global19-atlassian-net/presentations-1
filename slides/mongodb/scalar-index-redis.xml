Secondary indexing with Redis

Redis is not exactly a key-value store, since values can be complex data
structures. However it has an external key-value shell: at API level data is
addressed by the key name. It is fair to say that, natively, Redis only offers
primary key access. However since Redis is a data structures server, its
capabilities can be used for indexing, in order to create secondary indexes of
different kinds, including composite (multi-column) indexes.
