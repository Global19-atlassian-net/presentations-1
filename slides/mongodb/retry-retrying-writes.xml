<title>Retrying Writes</title>

<blurb>Given that:</blurb>
<list>
	<bullet><small>Sessions are cluster-wide and exist beyond the scope of a connection</small></bullet>
	<bullet><small>Each write can be uniquely identified by a session and statement ID</small></bullet>
	<bullet><small>Drivers can rely on SDAM and server selection to re-select the primary</small></bullet>
</list>

<blurb>Drivers can safely retry single-document writes by resending the original command to the primary:</blurb>

<list>
	<bullet><small>If the write already executed, return the result we missed</small></bullet>
	<bullet><small>If the write never executed, do it now and return its result</small></bullet>
</list>

note:
Single-document writes excludes updateMany and deleteMany. Doctrine ODMâ€™s
UnitOfWork generates many single-document writes, so it is a great candidate
for retrying writes (or transactions).
