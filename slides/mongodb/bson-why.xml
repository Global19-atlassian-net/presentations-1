	<bullet>"JSON"'s range of data types is restricted</bullet>

			<bullet>*Lightweight*: Keeping spatial overhead to a minimum is important for any data representation format, especially when used over the network.</bullet>
			<bullet>*Traversable*: BSON is designed to be traversed easily. This is a vital property in its role as the primary data representation for MongoDB.</bullet>
