        We divide the surface of the earth into cells
        <list>
            <bullet>A library called S2 from Google does the hard work</bullet>
        </list>
    </bullet>
    <bullet>Cells have a level which define the size of the cell</bullet>
    <bullet>S2 provides 31 levels</bullet>
    <bullet>The higher the level, the smaller the cell, and therefore the more needed to cover the earth</bullet>
    <bullet>By default, we use all levels between 500m on a side and 100km on a side</bullet>
