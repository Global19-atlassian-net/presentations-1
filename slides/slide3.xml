<slide title="Your first Slide">
<blurb>
Now that we have defined a simple presentation containing just 3 slides, we can
start creating them.  You can either use slides from an existing directory or
create a new one:
</blurb>
<example type="shell">mkdir slides/foo</example>
<blurb>
The first slide tends to be a titlepage for the presentation.
A simple automatic titlepage generator is included which uses the information in
the presentation definition file.  Simply copy %titlepage.xml% into your slides
directory and as you saw in the presentation definition file the first slide
was defined to be %slides/foo/titlepage.xml%.
</blurb>
<example type="shell">cp slides/titlepage.xml slides/foo</example>
<blurb>
Your titlepage should now work.
</blurb>
</slide>
