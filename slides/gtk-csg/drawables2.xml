  'expose_event' is generated when the window or a portion of it has
  become visible and needs to be redrawn. Simply draw the offscreen pixmap
  you've so thoughtfully created to the window and be done.
 </blurb>

 <blurb fontsize="3em">
  'configure_event' is generated anytime the window is resized. You
  don't necessarily have to handle it, but then the size of your
  offscreen pixmap and onscreen window may not match up.
 </blurb>

 <blurb fontsize="3em">
  Word of caution: be careful about creating too many unnecessary
  pixmaps, as the old ones do not get destroyed in the current version
  of PHP-GTK. Either disallow resizing the drawing area or create a big
  pixmap upfront and use only a portion of it.
