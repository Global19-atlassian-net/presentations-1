  Application's icon can be used for various purposes by the window managers on
  Windows and Unix: it can identify the application when it is minimized to the
  desktop, for example, or it can be displayed next to application's name in
  the taskbar, etc.
 </blurb>

 <blurb fontsize="3em">
  Unfortunately, Gtk+ 1.2.x for Win32 does not support setting the icon
  programmatically. But on other platforms one should do this:
 </blurb>

 <example fontsize="1.7em"><![CDATA[<?php
  // create top-level application window
  $win = &new GtkWindow();
  // make sure GdkWindow is created
  $win->realize();
  $gdkwin = $win->window;
  list($pixmap, $mask) =
     gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm($gdkwin, null, "icon.xpm");
  $gdkwin->set_icon(null, $pixmap, $mask);
?>]]></example>


 <blurb fontsize="3em">
  The first parameter to set_icon() is a GdkWindow which can serve as an icon
  for the window when it is minimized. Only certain window managers support
  this functionality, though.
