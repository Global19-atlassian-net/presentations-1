  It is possible (albeit a bit complicated) to go the other way and create a
  GdkPixbuf image from a GdkDrawable. This can be used to take a pixmap that
  had something drawn on with GDK operations and then scale it or composite
  over another image, or capture contents of an arbitrary window.

 GdkPixbuf gdkpixbuf::get_from_drawable(GdkPixbuf   $dest,

  Note that this function is not a GdkPixbuf method, since $dest can
  be a null. If $dest is null, the function will create a GdkPixbuf of
  the dimensions given by $width and $height and will transfer the
  graphical contents of the specified drawable to the pixbuf. In this
  case, $dest_x and $dest_y have to be 0. If $dest is not null, then
  the function will transfer the pixmap at the destination
  coordinates.
