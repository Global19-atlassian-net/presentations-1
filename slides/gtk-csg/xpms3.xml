  What a good is a pixmap when you can't display it?
  There are couple of approaches to doing this.
 </blurb>

 <list>
  <bullet>
   Create a drawing area, hook up to expose_event, and draw the pixmap onto it
   as seen before. Although doing it for every icon you are going to display
   will drive you crazy.
  </bullet>

  <bullet>
   Use GtkPixmap class which provides a simple pixmap container.

 <example><![CDATA[<?php
  list($pixmap, $mask) =
     gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm($window->window,
                                 null, "gtk-logo.xpm");
  $gtkpix = &new GtkPixmap($pixmap, $mask);
  $window->add($gtkpix);
?>]]></example>
