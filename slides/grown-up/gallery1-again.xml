	'In the beginning Bharat ~[the developer]~
	bought a digital camera and thought "*wouldn't it be nice* if I could put
	these photos somewhere." But when Gallery 1.x came into being, the
	developers had no idea what they were doing. They *didn't know PHP very well*,
	didn't understand the importance of separating code from content,
	didn't have a whole lot of database experience, you get the idea. So they
	started by *just writing something that worked*, and then slowly building
	upon it. The end result is Gallery 1.x which *works quite nicely* but
	internally is *a bit of a mess*.'
