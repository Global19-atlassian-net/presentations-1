	<blurb title="A possible problem">
		The client accessing the MDB web services has to wait
		for as long as it takes to get the results. This can be very
		inefficient if complex queries or analyses are requested.

	<blurb title="... and a solution: asynchronous access"/>
	<list type="arrow" fontsize="2.5em" marginright="1em">
		<bullet>
			Decouple the request and the retrieval of the results, to
			allow scheduling of query execution to periods of decreased server load.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			Query result caching: if the same query is requested by different clients,
			it will be executed only once.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			Flexible result/documentation delivery. For example, an external web application can
			register interest in knowing the latest metalloproteins indexed in the
			MDB, for that it will register a callback service, a method/protocol, and a
			result format.
