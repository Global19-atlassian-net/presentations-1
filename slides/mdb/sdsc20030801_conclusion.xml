   MDB shares data using a standarized file formats
   (e.g. RSS, CML) and well known
   web services protocols (REST, XML-RPC, SOAP)
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *REST* is the simplest way to share (publish a URL). Little or no modification needed
   to your CGI scripts. 
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *XML-RPC* is simple and has instrospection, but data with complex structure might not be easy to
   represent.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *SOAP* is more complex, but it gives you more flexibility (XML
   Schemas, RPC and Document Literal, WSDL, Service redirection, WS-Security, etc.)
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   Plan on synchronous and asynchronous access to improve performance.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   Implementing more than one protocol is no more difficult than implementing
   just one. Modularization is the key.
