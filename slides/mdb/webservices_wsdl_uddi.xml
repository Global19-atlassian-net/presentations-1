<slide title="WSDL &amp; UDDI">
	<blurb title="Web Services Description Language">
		Used for describing interfaces for Web Services. It is a general
		specification independent of SOAP (i.e. WSDL for REST services)
		and defines data types, interface definitions, transport
		bindings, and service descriptions.
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		WSDL makes creating SOAP proxies simpler (either dynamic or static),
		it can also be used for interface documentation, and can be integrated
		into development systems (code editors, class generators, etc.).
	</blurb>
	<blurb title="Universal Description Discovery and Integration">
		Defines a system for automated publishing and discovery of Web Services,
		allowing registries to be maintained for different purposes and contexts.
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		UDDI defines an API specification for publish and inquire for businesses and
		web services, a data structure, and several XML Schemas for custody,
		subscription policy, replication, etc.
