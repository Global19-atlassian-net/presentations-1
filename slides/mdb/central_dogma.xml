*DNA* serves as the _information storage medium_, which
is |ff0000|transcribed| into *RNA* (the _information transmission medium_),
which is finally |ff0000|translated| by a ribosome into a *Protein*

An text composed of 3-letter words (with 4 unique letters) gets
mapped into a sequence of 20 unique letters.
This is usually called 
"_The Central Dogma of Biology_"

... but the fun really starts when we want 
to go *from a sequence (1D) to a 3D structure*,
even more fun when we want to figure out the (probable) 
*function and properties* of the biomolecule.
