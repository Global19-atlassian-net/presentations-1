			Web client tells the SOAP server that it wants to be 
			informed whenever _new_ Cu-containing proteins are indexed in the MDB.
			Gives as callback the URL: _http://www.example.com/newcu.jsp_, and
			wants to recieve data in RSS format, using the HTTP POST method.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			MDB Web services know how to use POST and format data in RSS, so a
			registration ID is returned. ID can be used to unregister
			the callback, or modify it.
		</bullet>
 	<bullet>
			The following week, new protein structures are indexed. Five new
			Cu-containing proteins are found.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			MDB uses the registered URL and POSTs a RSS formatted document with
			information on the new Cu-containing proteins.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			Callback is repeated next week unless unregistered, modified, or
			if an error condition was encountered the previous week (e.g. a critical
			HTTP error).
