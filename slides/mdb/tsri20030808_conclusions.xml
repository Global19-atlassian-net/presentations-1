   You can use the MDB for interactive searches, from an interface that
   uses a java applet to see the strucutures in real time, to quick searches
   by PDB ID, to more complex searches and even SQL queries.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   You can do analysis like Metal-Ligand distance distributions interactively
   in about 2-3 seconds. Something that used to take ad-hoc analysis, and was
   the subject of full papers.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   More complex analysis tools are coming via the MSE: MSIT, Torsion angle
   distributions, ClusterGeom, etc.

   MDB shares data using a standarized file formats
   (e.g. RSS, CML) and well known
   web services protocols (REST, XML-RPC, SOAP)
  </bullet>
  <!-- bullet>
   *REST* is the simplest way to share (publish a URL). 
   *XML-RPC* is simple and has instrospection, but data with complex structure might not be easy to
   represent.
   *SOAP* is more complex, but it gives you more flexibility (XML
   Schemas, RPC and Document Literal, WSDL, Service redirection, WS-Security, etc.)
