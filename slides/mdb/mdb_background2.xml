  The MDB is part of a program project that focuses on understanding the
  metalloproteins structurally and functionally, to the level that we can do
  rational design and construction of new metalloproteins. The program project is
  (was) *The Metalloprotein Bioinformatics, Structure, and Design Program* at
  TSRI.

<blurb fontsize='3.2em'>To accomplish our objectives we need to:</blurb>
<list type='number'>
<bullet>Understand the geometrical requirements to bind a metal</bullet>
<bullet>Figure out the effect of the environmental constrains</bullet>
<bullet>Devise methods to design the sites</bullet>
<bullet>Analyze the possible candidates</bullet>
<bullet>Make the sites</bullet>
<bullet>Find out where we suceeded and where we failed</bullet>
<bullet>Go back to step 1</bullet>
</list>
<blurb>
 Thus, building a quantitative database was critical.
