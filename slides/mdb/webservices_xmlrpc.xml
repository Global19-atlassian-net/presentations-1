		"It's a spec and a set of implementations that allow software running on
		disparate operating systems, running in different environments to make
		procedure calls over the Internet." [1]
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		"It's remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the
		encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing
		complex data structures to be transmitted, processed and returned." [1]
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		It supports server introspection. Making it easy for a client application to
		interrogate and discover the available methods and their paramaters.
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		XML-RPC also supports "box-carring" of requests, i.e. sending a series
		of RPC calls at one time. Uses the *system.multicall* method.
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		It does not support message passing/redirection, or complex data type
		definitions. But it does support mappings to simple and structured data
		types to/from many languages.
