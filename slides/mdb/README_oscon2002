Mozilla seems to get confused w/ JAR files, So, you will need to extract the
class files from rssApplet13.jar for the slide rssapplet.xml to work.
Assuming PRES2DIR to be the path to where you checked out 'pres2' from CVS.

$ cd PRES2DIR/
$ jar xf presentations/slides/mdb/rssApplet13.jar
$ rm -fr META-INF

You should now have a "com" tree under PRES2DIR and Mozilla should be happy.

Several of the examples also assume that the presentations and slides are
under the PRES2DIR path.
