<blurb title="Our research program">
The MDB is part of a bigger research program, which focuses on
metalloprotein research and design: 
_*The Metalloprotein Bioinformatics, Structure, and Design Program*_

<list title='The Objectives' type='darrow'>
<bullet>Figure out what makes a metalloprotein tick</bullet>
<bullet>Rational design and construction of new metalloproteins</bullet>
</list>
<list title='What do we need to do' type='number'>
<bullet>Understand the geometrical requirements to bind a metal</bullet>
<bullet>Figure out the effect of the environmental constrains</bullet>
<bullet>Devise methods to design the sites</bullet>
<bullet>Analyze the possible candidates</bullet>
<bullet>Make the sites</bullet>
<bullet>Find out where we suceeded and where we failed</bullet>
<bullet>Go back to step 1</bullet>
</list>

These are the reasons why we built the Metalloprotein-site Database and
