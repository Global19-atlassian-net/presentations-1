		observations (_data_), the understanding of how a system works
		(_information_), and the subsequent application of these principles
		(_knowledge_).

	<blurb title='Research areas (by "dimensionality")'>
		*1D,2D*: Gene identification in Genome,
		sequence analysis (similarity, evolutionary distances, etc.),
		expression dynamics, etc.
	</blurb>
	<blurb>
		*3D*: Structure similarities, dynamic changes,
		protein folding, structure-function relationships, etc.

		*nD*: Protein ensembles in a cell,
		interaction networks, expression pathways, etc.
