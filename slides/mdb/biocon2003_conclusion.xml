			Bioinformatic Web Applications *must* implement Web Services.
			Small effort to implement them, and high payoffs in terms 
			of sharing, collaboration, and knowledge integration.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			Use REST, XML-RPC, SOAP, or the [RPC flavor of the month]. Just
			keep them nice and simple, your fellow researchers will 
			love you for that.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			*REST* is the simplest way to share. We've been doing it since
			the CGI spec appeared. No spec on how to represent
			the returned data.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			*XML-RPC* is simple, but data with complex structure might not be easy to
			represent.
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			*SOAP* is a more complex, but it gives you more flexibility (XML
			Schemas, RPC and Document Literal, WSDL, Service redirection, etc.)
		</bullet>
		<bullet>
			Plan on synchronous and asynchronous access to improve performance.
			Consider XML Spaces and similar Tuple/Data Spaces.

		<bullet>
			Use the MDB Web Services. Use the MDB Web Services. Use the MDB Web
			Services...
