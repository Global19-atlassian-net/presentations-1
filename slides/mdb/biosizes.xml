To wrap up the tour, let's use a couple of more "tangible"
comparisons to make all of this clear:
</blurb>
<blurb>
If a _protein_ were of the size of a _grain of rice_, then
a cell will be the size of a room 10 m x 10 m x 10 m.
(approximately 33 ft x 33 ft x 33 ft for the non-metric minds)
</blurb>
<blurb>
And, if a _cell_ were the size of a _grain of rice_, then
the _tip of your pinkie finger_ will be the size
of that 10 m x 10 m x 10 m room.
</blurb>
<blurb>
Bottom line: "Plenty of proteins in them cells,
and plenty of cells in them pinkies"
