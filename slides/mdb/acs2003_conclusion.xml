   Share data using a standarized file format
   (e.g. RSS, CML), better yet, via a standard 
   web services protocol: REST, XML-RPC, SOAP.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *REST* is the simplest way to share. We've been doing it since
   the CGI spec appeared. 
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *XML-RPC* is simple, but data with complex structure might not be easy to
   represent.
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   *SOAP* is more complex, but it gives you more flexibility (XML
   Schemas, RPC and Document Literal, WSDL, Service redirection, etc.)

  <bullet>
   Plan on synchronous and asynchronous access to improve performance.
