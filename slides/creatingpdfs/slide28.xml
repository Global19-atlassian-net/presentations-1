    <blurb title="Using PDFLib templates">
      Often, especially on multi-page PDF documents a consistent look and feel is desired.
      Rather than re-drawing the same basic things on every page templates can be used to
      and then placed as needed. Creating a template is much like creating a PDF page:
    </blurb>
    <list>
      <bullet>Begin a new Template (%pdf_begin_template()%)</bullet>
      <bullet>Render the content for the template</bullet>
      <bullet>Close the Template (%pdf_end_template()%)</bullet>
      <bullet>Place the template on a PDF page as necessary as an image (%pdf_place_image()%)</bullet>
    </list>)%
    <blurb>
      Note: Templates must be created outside the context of a page (must be called before %pdf_begin_page()%
      and after %pdf_end_page()%
    </blurb>
