        PDFLib supports a wide range of functions to load and then use Images within
        a PDF Page. However it is recommended that you avoid as many of them as possible.

        A much more reasonable course of action is to load the image using the GD extension
        and then using the %pdf_open_memory_image()% function instead. This function will
        convert a GD image resource into a PDF image resource that can be placed on a page
