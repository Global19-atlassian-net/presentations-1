and use them.</bullet>

<blurb fontsize="1.5em">The UDDI specifications define Web service interfaces to allow 
programmatic access to the UDDI registry information. The UDDI API is 
based on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) which provides a synchronous 
RPC mechanism to UDDI. All UDDI registry Operator sites will support all 
the UDDI API calls. The UDDI API is divided into two logical parts:</blurb>
<list>
<bullet fontsize="1em">Inquiry API: Provide programs with the capability to locate candidate 
businesses, Web services and then services, and drill into the specifics based 
on overview information provided in the initial calls. The Inquiry API functions 
are exposed as SOAP messages over HTTP. No authentication is required to make 
use of the Inquiry API functions.</bullet>
<bullet fontsize="1em">Publisher API: Enables programs to save and delete each of four data 
types supported by UDDI. Authenticated access is required to use the Publisher 
API, i.e. the user must first sign-up with one or more operator sites to establish 
user credentials.</bullet>
