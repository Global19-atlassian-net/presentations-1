<slide title="Results as Strings II">

<blurb>As with arrays, for increased performance you can combine data retrieval with query execution.</blurb>

<example fontsize="1.6em" result="1" type="php" filename="string2.php" />

<blurb>Since there is more then 1 row being returned the result in actually an array with numeric indexes rather then a plain string.</blurb>
