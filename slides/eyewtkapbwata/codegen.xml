<slide title="PHP-GTK Code Generator">

 <list title="What the heck is it?" fontsize="4em">
  <bullet>PHP-GTK consists of about 100 classes, 1000 methods, and 600 constants..</bullet>
  <bullet>..not counting the extensions</bullet>
  <bullet>Writing them by hand would become mind-numbingly tedious</bullet>
  <bullet>But the generator helps tremendously and eases development of new
   PHP-GTK extensions</bullet>
  <bullet>The header files are converted to definition (.defs) files which are converted to C code</bullet>
  <bullet>It is possible to hide any method or override it a custom implementation</bullet>
