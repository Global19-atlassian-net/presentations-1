	<blurb class="quote">"PHP is nothing but a bunch of GARBAGE! Every site that I've encountered
	that uses any form of PHP is FULL OF BUGS, especially photo publishing
	and uploading sites in particular! I CAN'T BELIEVE you morons would
	release such a worthless server language into the public that is not
	even the slightest bit RELIABLE! Do yourselves a favor, TRASH PHP until
	you can get a bunch of experienced people together who know what the
	hell they are doing, instead of a bunch of HACKERS!</blurb>
