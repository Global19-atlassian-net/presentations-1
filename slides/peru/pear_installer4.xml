Package                Math_Quaternion
Summary                Classes that define Quaternions and their
                       operations
Description            Classes that represent and manipulate
                       quaternions. Contain definitions
                       for basic arithmetic functions in a static
                       class.
                       Quaternions are an extension of the idea of
                       complex numbers, and
                       a quaternion is defined as:
                        q = a + b*i + c*j + d*k
                       In 1844 Hamilton described a system in which
                       numbers were composed of
                       a real part and 3 imaginary and independent
                       parts (i,j,k), such that:
                        i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1 and
                        ij = k, jk = i, ki = j and
                        ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j
                       The above are known as "Hamilton's rules"

Category    PHP
Summary     Provides missing functionality for older
            versions of PHP
Description PHP_Compat provides missing functionality in the
            form of constants and functions for older
            versions of PHP.

            Note: PHP_Compat can be used without installing
            PEAR.
            1) Download the package by clicking the
            "Download" link.
            2) Find the file you need. Each function is in
            its own file, e.g. array_walk_recursive.php.
            3) Place this file somewhere in your
            include_path.
            4) Include it, e.g. <?php require_once
            'array_walk_recursive.php';?>
            The function is now ready to be used.
