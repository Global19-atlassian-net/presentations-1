<blurb>
PHP 5 introduced a number of new XML extensions: %SOAP%, %SimpleXML%, %XSL%, %DOM%
</blurb>

<break />

<blurb>
Older %XLST% and %DOMXML% were removed in favor of their newer counterparts.
</blurb>

<blurb>
All XML extensions now use a single XML parsing library, LibXML2, unlike the older
%Expat% this library is too big to bundle, however it is available by default on most systems.

Additional XML extensions for PHP 5 are available from PECL repository (%XmlReader% &amp; %XmlWriter%)
