In PHP 4 constructors were supported by creating a function with the same name as the class.
</blurb>

<example filename="obj_con_des4.php" fontsize="1.5em" />

<blurb>
In PHP 5, the %__construct()% method will be called (if it exists) when the object is created, 
and the %__destruct()% method when it is destroyed. 
</blurb>

<example filename="obj_con_des5.php" fontsize="1.5em" />
