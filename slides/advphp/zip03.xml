%ext_skel% is an automated tool for creating PHP extensions, it sets up the 
initial directory information, and creates basic skeleton files (with the 
option of documentation).

sample.php [done].

To use your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps:

1.  $ cd ..
2.  $ vi ext/sample/config.m4
3.  $ ./buildconf
4.  $ ./configure --[with|enable]-sample
5.  $ make
6.  $ ./php -f ext/sample/sample.php
7.  $ vi ext/sample/sample.c
8.  $ make

Repeat steps 3-6 until you are satisfied with ext/sample/config.m4 and
step 6 confirms that your module is compiled into PHP. Then, start writing
code and repeat the last two steps as often as necessary.]]></example>
