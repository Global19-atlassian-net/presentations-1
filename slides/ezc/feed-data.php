  We don\'t support GPG at the moment, however we now recognize it and ignore keys

- Added the ezcMailSmtpTransport::keepConnection() method. This allows keeping
  the connection open when sending several mails.
- Added the ezcMail::messageID property which represents the ID of a mail
  message.
- Added the ezcMail::timestamp property which is generated from the Date
  header.
- Added the ezcMailMboxTransport and changed ezcMailMboxSet to work together
  with that one.
- Added $encoding parameter to ezcMailTools::parseMailAddress and
  ezcMailTools::parseMailAddresses. This allows you to parse not only
  RFC822 compliant address strings but also address strings in local
  encoding. This is useful when ezcMailAddress items directly from
  user inserted address string (e.g from a composer window).
- Implemented feature request #8266: Property for the Content-Disposition
  stuff on the ezcMailPart level. Implemented for both parsing and sending.
- Changed mime string decoding to be more robust by trying to work around
  common mistakes by MUAs.
- Changed the way how character sets are handled. From now on all text parts
  will automatically be converted to UTF-8. The original character set
  belonging to the e-mail is stored in the originalCharset property, while the
  charset property will now always return "UTF-8" for text parts.
- Changed header storage so that headers are now stored case sensitive but
  retrieved case insensitive. This is useful since headers are case
  insensitive, but do have a preferred case. When fetching headers it is handy
  not to have to try all possible permutations.
- Fixed a bug where parsing would fail because there was no trailing \';\' in

- Changed the way how character sets are handled. From now on all text parts
  will automatically be converted to UTF-8. The original character set
  belonging to the e-mail is stored in the originalCharset property, while the
  charset property will now always return "UTF-8" for text parts.
- Changed header storage so that headers are now stored case sensitive but
  retrieved case insensitive. This is useful since headers are case
  insensitive, but do have a preferred case. When fetching headers it is handy
  not to have to try all possible permutations.
- Fixed a bug where parsing would fail because there was no trailing \';\' in
  the Content-Type field.
- Fixed an issue where mime decoding of headers failed because of a bug in
  PHP.',
