		<bullet>The controller is created by the dispatcher from the routing
		information returned by the router.</bullet>
		<bullet>The controller is responsible for business logic and returns its
		results in an %ezcMvcResult% object.</bullet>
		<bullet>Users should implement inheritted classes to provide the
		actions.</bullet>
		<bullet>The "default" controller uses the actions name to map to a
		method, but this algorithm can be easily overridden.</bullet>

<example>&lt;?php
class helloController extends ezcMvcController
{
    public function doGreet()
    {
        $ret = new ezcMvcResult;
        $ret->variables['greeting'] = 'Hello World!';
        return $ret;
