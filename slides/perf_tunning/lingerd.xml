Because of some technical complications in the way TCP/IP and HTTP work, each Apache process currently wastes a lot 
of time "lingering" on client connections, after the page has been generated and sent. Lingerd takes over this job,
leaving the Apache process immediately free to handle a new connection. As a result, Lingerd makes it possible to
serve the same load using considerably fewer Apache processes.
