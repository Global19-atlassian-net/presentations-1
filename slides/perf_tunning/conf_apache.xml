Since the webserver plays an important part in the request serving process, it is important to tune it. A big part of this
is the Apache child creation process.

<list fontsize="3.3em">
	<bullet>%StartServers% set to avg. # of requests you'd expect.</bullet>
	<bullet>%MaxSpareServers% keep this number high, to allow Apache to gracefully handle traffic spikes.</bullet>
	<bullet>%MaxClients% keep this number at about 2/5 of the maximum processes your server can handle.</bullet>
	<bullet>%MaxRequestsPerChild% ideally unlimited (0), but practically should be limited to a large number.</bullet>
