  PHP-GTK 2 (currently under development) is based on PHP 5 and Gtk+ 2.
 </blurb>

 <blurb>
  PHP 5 has a brand new object model that solves all the lingering technical
  issues and allows for much more powerful control of the Gtk+ 2 interface.

  <bullet>
   objects are no longer glorified arrays - they are always passed by reference
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   since objects have destructors, memory is properly cleaned up
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   no problems with method invocation (even something like %$button->get_child()->set_text()% is possible)
  </bullet>
 </list>

 <blurb>
  PHP 5 also adds a number of features to aid OO programming: abstract classes,
  interface, private and protected methods and variables, exceptions, and much
  more.
