  In a majority of cases, it is not advisable to set the size or position of the
  widget explicitly. The reason is that this disregards any external constraints
  that might be imposed on a widget, such as user's preference for the font
  size, resizing of the dialog box, the length of the button label in another
  language. It is best to let the containers choose the sizing and placement of
  their children.

  That said, a few widgets should have their size and position set manually.
  This includes *GtkWindow*, *GtkCTree*, *GtkCList*, and a couple of others.
  To accomplish this, use these methods:

 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php
  $window->set_usize($width, $height);
  $window->set_uposition($x, $y);
?>]]></example>
