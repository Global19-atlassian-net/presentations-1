<slide title="Theory: Containers" logo1="images/php-gtk.gif" navColor="#b0c2d3" navsize="1.4em">

 <blurb>Some widgets serve a higher purpose: they organize and present other widgets.</blurb>
 <blurb>These widgets are called ~containers~. This means that they may contain one or more of other widgets and control their relative layout as well as present some decoration alongside the contained widgets. Examples:</blurb>
 <list>
  <bullet fontsize="3ex">vertical box</bullet>
  <bullet fontsize="3ex">horizontal box</bullet>
  <bullet fontsize="3ex">table</bullet>
  <bullet fontsize="3ex">button</bullet>
 </list>
 <blurb>The contained widgets are container's ~children~.</blurb>
 <blurb>Containers usually respond to resize events and addition and removal of children by reallocating the available space among its remaining children.</blurb>
 <blurb>Since a container is also a widget, we can nest containers to an arbitrary degree: a vertical box containing a table containing a button containing a label.</blurb>
