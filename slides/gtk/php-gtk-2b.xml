Maybe I'm just a bit weird, but I just read
about (and started playing with) SQLite on PHP5 beta. 

Wow. 

Combine SQLite and PHP-GTK, and you have an INCREDIBLE development environment
for client-side or client-server development! 

Wow. 

I spent the last year putting together a 50,000 line software package, and did 
it all with data arrays because using SQL would be too "heavy" and a pain to 
write an installer for all the various releases of Windows, MacOS, Linux, 
etc. to be supported. 

So many loops, so many painful recursive functions... 
foreach($clients as $key => $client)... 

But, if SQLite is BUILT IN... 
select clients from clienttable... 

I could probably re-write this in 30k lines or less with SQL support. 

Wow. PHP-GTK2, Glade, SQLite. It's like LAMP all over again, only on Windows, 
OSX, Linux, Sparc, and god knows what else. This is truly a platform for 
quick, powerful, multi-platform, client-side GUI development under 
development... 

I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL PHP-GTK2 IS OUT!!!!!!! 

W00t!
