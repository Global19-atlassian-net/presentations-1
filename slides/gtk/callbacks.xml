<slide title="Theory: Callbacks" logo1="images/php-gtk.gif" navColor="#b0c2d3" navsize="1.4em">

 <blurb>The user-defined signal handlers are called ~callbacks~.</blurb>

 <blurb>The first parameter normally passed to callbacks is the widget that
 emitted the signal. The rest are signal-dependent. For example, the callback
 for 'switch_page' signal of GtkNotebook class would look like this:</blurb>
 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php function on_switch_page($notebook, $page, page_num) { } ?>]]></example>

 <blurb>The low-level event callbacks receive an additional parameter object
 describing the event. It has fields for event type, button number if it was a
 mouse click, key code if it was a key press, etc.</blurb>

 <blurb>It is possible to connect more than one callback to the same signal.
 They will be run in the order they are connected. It is also possible to
 simulate emission of a signal by the widget, for some custom purposes.</blurb>
