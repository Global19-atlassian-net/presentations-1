 <blurb>Creating a widget is not enough. You also have to make it appear on the
  screen. In order to do this use the %show()% or %show_all()% methods. There is
  a difference between these methods if the widget is a container.
 </blurb>

 <blurb>
  This will display the window, but not any of its contained children:
 </blurb>
 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php $window->show(); ?>]]></example>
 <blurb>
  This will display the window and all of its contained children:
 </blurb>
 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php $window->show_all(); ?>]]></example>

 <blurb>
  If a widget is inside a container and you call %show()% on it, it will not
  appear on screen until the container itself has been shown.
 </blurb>

 <blurb>
  Corresponding functions for hiding a widget are %hide()% and %hide_all()%.
