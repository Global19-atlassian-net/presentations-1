  Due to limitations of Zend Engine in PHP 4, PHP-GTK has some problematic
  issues.
 </blurb>

 <list fontsize="2.5ex">
  <bullet>
   byref constructor (using %&amp;new% instead of %new%, and not consistently at that)
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   method invocation on properties (%$button->child->set_text()% will not work)
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   memory deallocation (object destructors are never called)
  </bullet>
  <bullet>
   a couple of other minor ones
  </bullet>
 </list>

 <blurb>
  Since it is such a large codebase and API, the documentation is lagging. We
  only have one active person working on the English version of documentation
  and a couple of translators for other languages.
 </blurb>

 <blurb>
  The applications have to be distributed with their source code, which may be
  beneficial or disadvantageous depending on your point of view. Some attemps
  have been made to encode the source, but the solution is not quite there yet.
 </blurb>

  Finally, it would be nice to have a better way to install PHP-GTK applications
  on the desktop. There are some custom installers but a standard, professional
  one is still needed.
