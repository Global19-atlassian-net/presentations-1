 <blurb>
  A disabled, or ~insensitive~, widget does not respond to input and has a
  different visual appearance in order to indicate such state. To enable or
  disable a widget:
 </blurb>
 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php $button->set_sensitive($state); ?>]]></example>
 <blurb>
  where %$state% is %TRUE% or %FALSE%. If the widget is enabled, but its parent
  is not, then it is considered disabled as well. To test a widget's state:
 </blurb>
 <example fontsize="1.5ex"><![CDATA[<?php
  $state = $button->sensitive();
  $state = $button->is_sensitive();
?>]]></example>
 <blurb>
  The first method tests just the widget itself, while the second one takes into
  account its parent's state as well.
 </blurb>
