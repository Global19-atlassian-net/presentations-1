		Filters sound great... but everything comes with a price.
	</blurb>

	<list>
		<bullet>Filtered streams are essentially FIFOs</bullet>
		<bullet>%fseek()% is not possible</bullet>
		<bullet>PHP 5 only</bullet>
	</list>

		One of the aims of the filter API is code re-use; bzip2 stream
		is really just a file stream with bzip2 (de)compression added on top.
		So why not code it that way?
	</blurb>
	
	<blurb>
		Consider writing a more complex custom stream if you really must be able to %fseek()%.
	</blurb>

	<blurb>
		There ~is~ a filter API in 4.3.x, but it is not compatible with
		the much better PHP 5 API, so I'm not telling anyone how to use it.
