		Each instance of a stream has an ~abstract~ data pointer that can hold 
		underlying resource handle(s) and other stateful data required by your
		stream.
	</blurb>

	<blurb>
		Lets see how to write a very simple file based stream, using
		POSIX IO.
	</blurb>

	<example fontsize="1.5em" linenumbers="true">struct my_stream_data {
		int filedes;
}</example>

	<blurb>
		When we create our stream, we will store a pointer to the above structure
		in the ~abstract~ field of the stream structure.
	</blurb>

	<blurb>
		We can now move on and write the core operations for our stream...
