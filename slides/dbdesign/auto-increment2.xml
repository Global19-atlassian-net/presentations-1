	<example><![CDATA[user: I'm having a problem with my MySQL database :)
user: I have a Table with Field1, which has auto_increment attribute
user: Table has three records, with Field1 numbered 1, 2 and 3
user: now I'm using delete from Table where Field1 = 2 limit 1;
user: and next id is 4..
user: but I want it to use 2
user: I read something about resetting auto_increment.. is that
      the way to fix it then?
user: I'll run out of id's otherwise
user: but the thing is, this company wants to add a lot of
      pictures to their database
user: because selling pictures is what they do :)
user: now I made Field1 unsigned int, but what if it turns out to
      be not enough?
user: but, just out of curiosity.. is there a way to fill up gaps
      with auto_increment? :)]]></example>

			for unsigned int the company has to hire 20 photographers which
